Concatenating rollcall objects  (06/23/2006)

Check for redundancies in roll calls (06/23/2006)

Other fitting options in ideal (principal components, NOMINATE)

User-specified colors in plot.ideal
More control of labels in plot.ideal

Let users append additional MCMC output to an earlier run on the same
data (add need some sanity checks for this)
