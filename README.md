HurdledMR.jl is a Julia implementation of the Hurdle Distributed Multinomial Regression (HDMR), as described in:

Kelly, Bryan, Asaf Manela, and Alan Moreira (2017). Text Selection. Working paper

It includes a Julia implementation of the Distributed Multinomial Regression (DMR) model of Taddy (2015).

<!--## Quick start

To fit a Lasso path with default parameters:

```julia
fit(LassoPath, X, y, dist, link)
```

`dist` is any distribution supported by GLM.jl and `link` defaults to
the canonical link for that distribution.

To fit a fused Lasso model:

```julia
fit(FusedLasso, y, λ)
```

To fit a polynomial trend filtering model:

```julia
fit(TrendFilter, y, order, λ)
```

More documentation is available at [ReadTheDocs](http://lassojl.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

## TODO

 - User-specified weights are untested
 - Support unpenalized variables besides the intercept
 - Maybe integrate LARS.jl

   generalized linear) Lasso and Elastic Net coordinate paths. -->
